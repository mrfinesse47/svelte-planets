## Overview

A Small Solar System App built using the Svelte compiler/framework.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

## My process

I used Svelte and build it top down mobile first. I also kept it simple, and didn't rely on external packages. So no unecessary software bloat.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Svelte
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the first project I built using Svelte.

### Continued development

This project is complete. I now look forward to the next project.

### Useful resources

- [Svelte Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zojEMeQGGHs&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hlbrVO_2QFVqVPhlZmz7tO&ab_channel=TheNetNinja) - This tutorial from Youtube helped me grasp the basics of Svelte.

- [Svelte Interactive Tutorials](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics)
- The official Svelte documentation and tutorial was super helpful as well.
